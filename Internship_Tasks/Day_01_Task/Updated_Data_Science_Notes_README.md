## 1️⃣ What is Data Science?

-   **Definition:** The study of data to find meaningful insights that
    help a business grow.
-   **Simple Words:** Being a "Digital Detective" who uses math to solve
    problems.
-   **Real-Life Example:** Amazon looking at your past purchases to show
    you "Recommended for You" items.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2️⃣ Types of Data Analytics (Solving the Business Problem)

When a business has a problem (BP), they use these four steps:

### 1. Descriptive (What happened?)

-   **Definition:** Looking at past data to summarize history.
-   **Example:** A coffee shop seeing that they sold 50 lattes
    yesterday.

### 2. Diagnostic (Why did it happen?)

-   **Definition:** Digging deeper to find the cause of a result.
-   **Example:** Realizing latte sales were high because it was a very
    cold day.

### 3. Predictive (What will happen?)

-   **Definition:** Using patterns to guess future trends.
-   **Example:** Guessing that if next Tuesday is cold, they will sell
    50+ lattes again.

### 4. Prescriptive (What to do now?)

-   **Definition:** Suggesting the best action to take.
-   **Example:** Deciding to buy extra milk on Monday so they don't run
    out on Tuesday.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3️⃣ What is Data?

-   **Definition:** Information consisting of facts, numbers, or
    measurements.
-   **Primary Source:** Data you collect yourself (Internal).
    -   Example: Asking your customers to fill out a feedback form.
-   **Secondary Source:** Data from someone else (External).
    -   Example: Looking up a company's stock price on Yahoo Finance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4️⃣ Life Cycle of the Project

1.  Business Understanding
2.  Data Collection
3.  Data Preparation
4.  Data Cleaning/Wrangling
5.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
6.  Feature Engineering
7.  Model Building
8.  Model Evaluation
9.  Model Validation
10. Deployment
11. Monitoring & Maintenance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5️⃣ Data Science Applications

-   **Banking:** Detecting if a credit card transaction is Fraud.
-   **E-commerce:** Price Optimization (changing prices based on
    demand).
-   **Transport:** Route Optimization (finding the fastest way for a
    delivery truck).
-   **Healthcare:** Medical Image Analysis (AI finding diseases in
    X-rays).
-   **Education:** Grade Prediction (seeing which students need extra
    help).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6️⃣ Roles in DS / AI / ML

-   Data Analyst: Creates reports and charts.
-   Data Scientist: Builds predictive models.
-   Data Engineer: Builds the systems to store and move data.
-   ML Engineer: Puts machine learning models into real apps.
-   NLP Engineer: Teaches computers to understand human speech/text.
-   Business Analyst: Connects data insights to business goals.
-   BI Developer: Builds dashboards for managers to watch.
-   Analytic Engineer: Cleans data specifically for analysts to use.
-   Data Architect: Designs the big-picture "map" of the data system.
-   AI Engineer: Builds smart systems like chatbots.
-   AI Specialist: Expert in a specific AI field (like vision or
    ethics).
-   Product Analyst: Analyzes how people use a specific app feature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7️⃣ Python & Libraries

-   **Python:** A simple programming language that reads like English.
    -   Advantages: Easy to learn, huge community, works everywhere.
-   **NumPy:** For fast math with numbers.
-   **Pandas:** For working with tables (like Excel).
-   **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly:** For drawing graphs and charts.
-   **Scikit-Learn:** For basic Machine Learning.
-   **TensorFlow / PyTorch:** For Deep Learning (advanced AI).
-   **Open CV:** For "Computer Vision" (letting computers see images).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8️⃣ Advanced Terms (AI / ML / DL)

-   **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** Machines acting smart like humans.
-   **ML (Machine Learning):** Machines learning from data patterns.
-   **DL (Deep Learning):** Advanced ML that works like a human brain.
-   **NLP:** Helping computers understand human language.
-   **Gen AI:** AI that creates new things (text, images, music).
-   **RAG:** Giving an AI your specific documents to make it smarter.
-   **LangChain:** A tool to build AI apps easily.
